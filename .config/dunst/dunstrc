# Dunst config
#
# An example configuration file: /usr/share/dunst/dunstrc
# Due to a terrible bug, dunst doesn't automatically reload its configuration.
# The user should do it manually. Reload dbus:
#     $ export $(dbus-launch)
# or:
#     $ eval $(dbus-launch)
#
# Then send a test notification:
#     $ notify-send "Title" "Message" --urgency=[critical|normal|low]

    ### Legacy

    # Use the Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support.

    # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.

# SCRIPTING

# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
