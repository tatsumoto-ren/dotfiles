# Dunst config
#
# An example configuration file: /usr/share/dunst/dunstrc
# Due to a terrible bug, dunst doesn't automatically reload its configuration.
# The user should do it manually. Reload dbus:
#     $ export $(dbus-launch)
# or:
#     $ eval $(dbus-launch)
#
# Then send a test notification:
#     $ notify-send "Title" "Message" --urgency=[critical|normal|low]

    ### Legacy

    # This setting is provided for compatibility with older nVidia drivers that
    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly

    # If this setting is enabled the Xft.dpi value will be ignored and instead

    # where there are multiple screens with very different dpi values.

# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.

#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
